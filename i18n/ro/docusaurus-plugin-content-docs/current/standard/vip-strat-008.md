# VIP-STRAT-008  
## Standardization Strategy

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the long-term strategy for the international recognition of the VeriSeal Integrity Protocol (VIP) as a global integrity standard.

VIP is designed to evolve from:

Commercial deployment → Industry adoption → Institutional recognition → International standard candidate.

---

## 2. Strategic Positioning

VIP positions itself as:

- A deterministic integrity layer
- Vendor-neutral
- Jurisdiction-neutral
- Compatible with sovereign infrastructures

It does not compete with blockchain protocols or signature standards.  
It complements them through structural integrity anchoring.

---

## 3. Three-Phase Standardization Path

### Phase 1 — Commercial Legitimacy

- Multi-sector deployment
- Institutional pilots
- Audit transparency
- Certification model implementation

### Phase 2 — Industry Recognition

- Cross-border interoperability
- Third-party implementations
- Governance maturity
- Registry stability

### Phase 3 — Formal Standardization Candidacy

- Engagement with standard bodies
- Structured documentation set
- Multi-jurisdiction compatibility
- Conformance validation programs

---

## 4. Non-Dependence Principle

VIP must not depend on:

- A single government
- A single cloud provider
- A single anchoring network
- A single certification authority

Structural neutrality is mandatory for global acceptance.

---

## 5. International Credibility Conditions

VIP must demonstrate:

- Deterministic verification reproducibility
- Threat-model transparency
- Governance independence
- Certification integrity

Only then can it credibly claim global standard candidacy.

---

## 6. Western / Global Compatibility

VIP is designed to be:

- Compatible with Western regulatory frameworks
- Compatible with US evidentiary principles
- Compatible with EU compliance frameworks
- Deployable globally without jurisdiction lock-in

The objective is global interoperability, not regional dependency.

---

## 7. Long-Term Objective

VIP aims to become:

A reference integrity protocol for digital evidence across sectors.

Not mandatory.
Not political.
Not ideological.

Structural, deterministic, and verifiable.
