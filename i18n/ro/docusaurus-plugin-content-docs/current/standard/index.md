# The VeriSeal Standard

The VeriSeal Standard defines the deterministic integrity framework that governs
how digital evidence is structured, sealed, verified, and preserved.

It is not a feature specification.
It is a structural integrity protocol.

---

## Purpose

The standard establishes:

- Deterministic cryptographic integrity
- Append-only proof ledger architecture
- Verification reproducibility
- Governance and conformance model
- Long-term archival stability

---

## Structure of the Standard

The VeriSeal Standard is composed of:

- VIP-STD series — Core integrity specifications
- VIP-REG series — Regulatory mapping
- VIP-THREAT series — Threat modeling
- VIP-STF — Security and trust framework
- Roadmap & Governance layers

---

## Positioning

The VeriSeal Standard is designed to:

- Operate independently of jurisdiction
- Be commercially deployable
- Remain sovereignty-compatible
- Scale globally across sectors

It aims to become a global integrity reference layer.
