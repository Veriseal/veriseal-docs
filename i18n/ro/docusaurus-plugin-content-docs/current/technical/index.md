# Technical Architecture

This section describes the cryptographic and structural mechanisms
underlying the VeriSeal integrity framework.

---

## Core Components

- Cryptographic hashing model
- Proof ledger construction
- Verification procedures
- Integrity vs blockchain distinction
- Timestamping and anchoring logic

---

## Design Principles

VeriSeal is built around:

- Determinism
- Reproducibility
- Independence from trust assumptions
- Minimal attack surface
- Long-term verifiability

---

This section is intended for engineers, auditors, and system architects.
