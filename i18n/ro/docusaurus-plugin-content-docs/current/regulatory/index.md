# Regulatory Framework

VeriSeal does not depend on regulation,
but it is compatible with regulatory environments.

This section maps the protocol against:

- Financial compliance frameworks
- Legal admissibility standards
- Digital identity regulations
- Cross-border evidence requirements

---

The objective is structural compatibility,
not regulatory dependency.
