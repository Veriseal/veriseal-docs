# Part IV – Deployment & Industrialization

Part IV addresses a decisive question:

Can this architecture operate at institutional scale?

A proof infrastructure aspiring to global relevance must demonstrate:

- Multi-model deployability
- Horizontal scalability
- Operational resilience
- Governance-compatible evolution
- Economic sustainability
- Transparent limitation boundaries

Standardization is not theoretical.

It requires industrial discipline.

Part IV defines the conditions under which VeriSeal can evolve from
a deployable infrastructure
to a globally recognized integrity reference.
