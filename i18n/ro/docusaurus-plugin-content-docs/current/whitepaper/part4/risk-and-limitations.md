# Risk & Limitation Transparency

## Integrity vs Truth

VeriSeal guarantees:

- Integrity preservation
- Structural immutability
- Deterministic verification

It does not guarantee:

- Truthfulness of content
- Intent of actors
- Upstream system integrity

---

## Cryptographic Assumptions

Cryptographic models rely on current assumptions.

Architecture must support algorithm agility
without invalidating historical proofs.

---

## Upstream Integration Risk

Improper process integration may:

- Seal incorrect data
- Introduce operational errors
- Create governance inconsistencies

Infrastructure must be accompanied by integration discipline.

---

## Standardization Risk

Becoming a standard requires:

- Cross-sector adoption
- Governance stability
- Backward compatibility
- Ecosystem integration

Standard emergence cannot be forced.
