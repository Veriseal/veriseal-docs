# Governance & Trust Model

## The Governance Problem

Any infrastructure aspiring to global relevance must answer:

- Who controls verification?
- How is evolution managed?
- How is lock-in avoided?
- How are historical proofs preserved?

Without governance clarity, trust collapses.

---

## Layer Separation

VeriSeal separates:

### 1. Proof Layer (Verifiable)
- JSON canonical output
- Hash structure
- Chaining logic
- Verification rules

### 2. Execution Layer (Controlled)
- Infrastructure orchestration
- Optimization
- Deployment logic
- Operational tooling

Verification does not depend on execution control.

---

## Vendor Independence

Proofs must remain verifiable:

- without operator permission,
- across time,
- across organizational restructuring,
- across jurisdictional boundaries.

Verification logic is reproducible.

---

## Backward Compatibility

Protocol evolution must preserve:

- Immutable historical proofs
- Deterministic verification
- Non-destructive upgrades

Infrastructure cannot break history.

---

## Sovereignty Compatibility

VeriSeal supports:

- SaaS deployment
- Private nodes
- Sovereign on-premise infrastructure
- Hybrid models

Verification remains consistent.

This enables adoption across jurisdictions  
without architectural fragmentation.

---

## Hybrid Governance Model

Total openness risks commoditization and fragmentation.  
Total opacity blocks adoption.

VeriSeal operates through:

- Transparent verification logic
- Controlled execution layer
- Commercial sustainability
- Governance discipline

Trust requires structure, not rhetoric.
