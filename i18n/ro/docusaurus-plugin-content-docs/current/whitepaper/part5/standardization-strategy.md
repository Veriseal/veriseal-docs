# 5.4 Standardization Strategy

## From Infrastructure to Format Convergence

Infrastructure dominance does not emerge from branding.

It emerges from format convergence.

---

## Canonical Proof Format

VeriSeal defines:

- Canonical JSON proof object
- Deterministic hashing logic
- Reproducible verification procedure
- Public validation pathway

Open verification principle:

Anyone can verify.

No proprietary validator required.

---

## Gradual Convergence Model

Standard emergence occurs when:

- Multiple sectors adopt compatible logic
- Verification procedures stabilize
- Historical continuity is preserved
- Governance discipline remains consistent

Mandates follow adoption.

Not the reverse.

---

## International Trajectory

Standardization may occur through:

- Industry consortium alignment
- Regulatory referencing
- Cross-border interoperability frameworks
- Institutional coalition support

The strategy is structural alignment.

Not political acceleration.
