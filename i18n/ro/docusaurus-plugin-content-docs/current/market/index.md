# VeriSeal  
## The Global Integrity Infrastructure

VeriSeal is a deterministic cryptographic proof infrastructure designed to reduce structural digital uncertainty across regulated and high-value sectors.

It is not a productivity tool.  
It is not a simple timestamping service.  
It is not a blockchain wrapper.

VeriSeal is a foundational integrity layer.

## Why This Matters

Digital systems are increasingly exposed to:

- Synthetic media (AI-generated content)
- Cross-border regulatory fragmentation
- Non-deterministic verification models
- Evidence disputes and legal ambiguity

The global economy lacks a unified, deterministic integrity architecture.

VeriSeal addresses that gap.

- API-native deployment
- Enterprise integration ready
- Multi-sector applicability
