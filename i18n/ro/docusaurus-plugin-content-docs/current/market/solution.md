# Deterministic Integrity Infrastructure

VeriSeal introduces a layered integrity model.

---

## 1. Deterministic Hashing Model

- Canonical data normalization
- Cryptographic hashing (SHA-256 class)
- Immutable binding across proof elements

Integrity becomes mathematically reproducible.

---

## 2. Append-Only Ledger Model

- Structured proof entries
- Sequential hash chaining
- Long-term verification stability

No retroactive modification possible.

---

## 3. Verification Protocol

- Independent reproducibility
- No reliance on proprietary black-box logic
- Transparent validation procedure

Verification is structural, not declarative.

---

## 4. Governance Layer

- Conformance model
- Certification logic
- Sector-specific implementation guidance

Infrastructure + Governance = Institutional viability.

VeriSeal operates beneath systems — not above them.
