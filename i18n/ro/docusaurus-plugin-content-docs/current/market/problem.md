# The Proof Crisis

Digital proof systems today suffer from four structural weaknesses.

---

## 1. Integrity Is Not Deterministic

Most systems rely on trust models, centralized attestations, or partial verification logic.

Deterministic structural integrity is rare.

---

## 2. Signature ≠ Structural Integrity

Electronic signatures validate identity intent.

They do not guarantee that:
- The document structure is immutable
- The event log is append-only
- The verification model is reproducible

---

## 3. Blockchain ≠ Governance

Blockchain anchoring ensures timestamping and immutability.

It does not provide:
- Conformance standards
- Certification models
- Sector-adapted governance
- Legal interpretability layer

---

## 4. Fragmentation Across Sectors

Banking, legal, healthcare, and public sector operate with incompatible proof logic.

No global integrity backbone exists.
