# Why Now

## 1. AI Reshapes Evidence

Synthetic media generation is accelerating.  
Distinguishing authentic digital events from manipulated ones is becoming structurally complex.

Traditional tools were not designed for this environment.

---

## 2. Regulatory Pressure Is Increasing

Across jurisdictions:

- Financial regulators demand traceability.
- Legal systems require evidentiary robustness.
- Cross-border compliance complexity is rising.

Integrity is no longer optional — it is strategic.

---

## 3. Digital Fragmentation

Current systems operate in silos:

- Platforms verify internally.
- Timestamping lacks structural binding.
- Blockchain anchoring lacks governance layer.
- E-signature lacks deterministic data structure integrity.

There is no unified global integrity model.

## 4. Strategic Window

The infrastructure layer for digital proof remains undefined at global scale.

VeriSeal enters at this structural inflection point.
