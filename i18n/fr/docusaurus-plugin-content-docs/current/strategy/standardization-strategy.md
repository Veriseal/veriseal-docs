# Standardization Strategy

VeriSeal does not declare itself a standard.

It positions itself as a candidate integrity reference.

---

## Phase 1 — De Facto Standardization

- Commercial adoption across sectors
- API integration within enterprise systems
- Certification program deployment
- Cross-border pilot programs

Objective:
Become operationally unavoidable.

---

## Phase 2 — Sector Endorsement

- Financial infrastructure pilots
- Legal and notarial validation
- Public-sector experimentation
- Regulatory sandbox discussions

Objective:
Gain institutional endorsement.

---

## Phase 3 — Formal Standard Dialogue

Potential engagement with:

- ISO working groups
- ETSI
- NIST discussions
- OECD digital trust initiatives
- Regional regulatory bodies

Objective:
Initiate formal reference positioning.

---

## Western Alignment Strategy (AB Layer)

Initial geopolitical focus:

- EU
- North America
- UK
- Australia

Rationale:
Regulatory maturity + digital infrastructure scale.

Global expansion follows institutional legitimacy.

---

## Long-Term Vision

VeriSeal becomes:

- A protocol reference
- A certification baseline
- A cross-sector integrity layer

Standardization is not claimed.

It is earned.
