# Standard Governance Model

A global integrity standard requires governance neutrality.

VeriSeal governance must evolve beyond its originating entity.

## Governance Principles

1. Technical Transparency  
2. Deterministic Specification Stability  
3. Institutional Inclusiveness  
4. Long-Term Archival Responsibility  
5. Geopolitical Neutrality  

Integrity standards must not be commercially captured.

## Separation Model
