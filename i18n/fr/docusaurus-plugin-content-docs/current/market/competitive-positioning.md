# Competitive Positioning

VeriSeal does not compete directly with productivity tools.

It occupies a structural layer.

---

| Category | What It Does | Structural Limitation |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| E-Signature Platforms | Identity validation | No deterministic structural integrity |
| Timestamping Services | Time anchoring | No governance model |
| Blockchain Solutions | Immutability | No standardized conformance |
| Compliance Software | Workflow control | No cryptographic backbone |
| **VeriSeal** | Deterministic integrity infrastructure | Designed for structural adoption |

---

VeriSeal is positioned as a foundational integrity protocol candidate.
