# 2.4 Sovereignty Model

VeriSeal is designed for sovereign deployment.

Regulated institutions require:

- Jurisdictional control  
- Key custody management  
- Infrastructure sovereignty  
- Compliance with national frameworks  

---

## Deployable Integrity Layer

VeriSeal can operate:

- On-premise  
- In sovereign cloud  
- In hybrid infrastructure  

Optional external anchoring does not compromise data location control.

---

## Key Management

Institutional deployments require:

- Secure key custody  
- Rotation procedures  
- Separation of duties  
- Audit logs  

Key governance is first-class.

---

## Regulatory Compatibility

The architecture supports:

- Banking regulation  
- Public sector constraints  
- Legal admissibility frameworks  
- Cross-border compliance  

Sovereignty is not ideological.  
It is operational.
