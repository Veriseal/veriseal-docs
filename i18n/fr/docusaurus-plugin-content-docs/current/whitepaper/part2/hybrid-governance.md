# 2.5 Hybrid Governance Model

VeriSeal follows a hybrid model:

- Proprietary execution engine  
- Open verification protocol  

This enables:

- Commercial sustainability  
- Institutional trust  
- Long-term structural continuity  

A global standard candidate does not require open-source.

It requires:

- Open verification  
- Deterministic reproducibility  
- Transparent structural rules  

VeriSeal is a commercial infrastructure.
It is also architected to become a global integrity reference layer.
