# Part II – The VeriSeal Architecture

Part II describes the technical architecture that transforms VeriSeal from a conceptual integrity thesis into a deployable infrastructure.

The architecture is designed to satisfy three simultaneous constraints:

1. **Deterministic cryptographic integrity**
2. **Institutional-grade operational robustness**
3. **Independent public verifiability**

VeriSeal is not built as a blockchain.
It is built as a structured integrity layer.

This section covers:

- Canonicalization and hashing model  
- Merkle aggregation and multi-artifact binding  
- Append-only ledger structure  
- Public verification architecture  
- Sovereignty and deployment model  
- Hybrid governance positioning  

The objective is not novelty.  
The objective is structural reliability.
