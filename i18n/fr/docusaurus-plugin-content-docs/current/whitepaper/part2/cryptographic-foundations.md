# Cryptographic Foundations

VeriSeal relies on established cryptographic primitives:
- hashing (e.g., SHA-256),
- asymmetric signatures for attestations,
- optional timestamp anchoring (e.g., blockchain/OpenTimestamps).

The goal is not novelty. The goal is determinism.

A proof must be:
- reproducible,
- verifiable by third parties,
- stable over time.

Cryptography provides mathematical integrity, not semantic truth.
