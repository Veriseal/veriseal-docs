# The Evidence Economy

Digital evidence is no longer peripheral.

It is foundational to economic systems.

Credit risk assessment, regulatory supervision, insurance adjudication, public procurement, and international trade all rely on digital attestations.

The integrity of these attestations now carries:

- Financial consequences
- Legal consequences
- Political consequences

As economies digitize, evidence becomes an economic primitive.

Yet evidence remains structurally fragmented.

No internationally recognized integrity standard governs:

- Cross-platform proof normalization
- Deterministic verification
- Long-term append-only integrity
- Sovereign-compatible deployment models

This creates a paradox:

The economy depends on digital evidence.

But digital evidence lacks standardized structural integrity.

The evolution from digitalization to evidence-driven economies requires a globally interoperable integrity layer.
