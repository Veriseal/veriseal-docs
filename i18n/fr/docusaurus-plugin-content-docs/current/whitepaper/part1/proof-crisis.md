# The Proof Crisis

Digital systems generate massive volumes of records.

But volume does not equal verifiability.

A structural proof crisis has emerged:

- Timestamping does not guarantee integrity.
- Digital signatures do not ensure structural immutability.
- Blockchain anchoring does not replace governance.
- Platform logs are not sovereign evidence.

Institutions increasingly face disputes in which:

- Evidence exists,
- But cannot be independently verified,
- Or lacks deterministic reproducibility.

The rise of AI-generated content intensifies this crisis.

Synthetic audio, video, and documents introduce epistemic uncertainty at scale.

The question is no longer:

"Was this recorded?"

The question is:

"Can this be independently and deterministically verified?"

Without a standardized integrity framework, digital evidence remains structurally fragile.
