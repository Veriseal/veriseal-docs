# 5.2 Economic Model

## Integrity-as-Infrastructure

VeriSeal is monetized not as storage,
but as:

Proof Infrastructure.

The core unit is:

Deterministic Proof Generation.

## Monetization Layers

### API Metered Usage
- Per proof generation
- Per verification call
- Per anchor submission

### Enterprise Licensing
- Volume-based usage tiers
- Governance-ready deployment
- Audit documentation support

### Sovereign Deployment
- Dedicated infrastructure
- Custom governance configuration
- Long-term operational commitment

---

## Structural Value Creation

Value derives from:

- Litigation compression
- Audit simplification
- Fraud exposure reduction
- Compliance automation
- Cross-system trust acceleration

Integrity becomes a cost-reduction vector.

## Infrastructure Economics

Infrastructure businesses exhibit:

- High initial trust threshold
- Long adoption cycles
- Strong retention once embedded
- Network-reinforced expansion

Proof infrastructure aligns with this pattern.

The economic model is built for stability, not volatility.
