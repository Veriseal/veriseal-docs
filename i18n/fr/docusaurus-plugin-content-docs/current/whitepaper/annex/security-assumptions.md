# Security Assumptions

VeriSeal relies on the following assumptions:

- SHA-256 remains collision resistant
- Signature schemes remain secure
- Canonical serialization is deterministic
- Private keys are protected under institutional governance
- Append-only ledger policy is enforced operationally

Security is cryptographic, but resilience is governance-dependent.
