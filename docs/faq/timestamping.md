# Timestamping & Anchoring FAQ

This section clarifies the role of timestamping and external anchoring within the VeriSeal integrity model.

Timestamping strengthens temporal defensibility.

It does not replace structural integrity.

---

## 1. Is timestamping mandatory in VeriSeal?

No.

Core integrity in VeriSeal is achieved through:

- Deterministic canonicalization
- SHA-256 hashing
- Independent recomputation capability

Timestamping is optional.

It strengthens temporal defensibility.

---

## 2. What is the difference between integrity and timestamping?

Integrity answers:

"Has this content changed?"

Timestamping answers:

"When did this state exist?"

Integrity is foundational.

Timestamping is complementary.

---

## 3. What does external anchoring provide?

External anchoring provides:

- Additional temporal corroboration
- External existence proof
- Increased dispute resilience

It strengthens chronological defensibility.

It does not replace internal integrity mechanisms.

---

## 4. Does VeriSeal require blockchain anchoring?

No.

VeriSeal is not dependent on blockchain.

External anchoring mechanisms may be used optionally.

Integrity does not require consensus networks.

---

## 5. If blockchain anchoring is used, does it expose data?

No.

Only hashes may be anchored.

Hashes:

- Do not reveal underlying content
- Do not expose confidential data
- Do not broadcast sensitive information

The original data remains private.

---

## 6. Does anchoring create regulatory exposure?

No.

Anchoring a hash does not:

- Publish personal data
- Transfer business records
- Create reporting obligations

Regulatory exposure depends on implementation design.

---

## 7. What happens if external anchoring services disappear?

Integrity proofs remain valid without anchoring.

Anchoring strengthens temporal defensibility.

It does not determine structural validity.

Vendor disappearance does not invalidate proof recomputation.

---

## 8. Can anchoring be performed internally?

Yes.

Institutions may:

- Use internal timestamp authorities
- Use external trust providers
- Use public networks
- Combine approaches

Deployment model is institution-controlled.

---

## 9. Does anchoring create dependence on Bitcoin or other networks?

No structural dependence exists.

If anchoring is used:

- It is optional
- It strengthens time corroboration
- It does not affect core integrity verification

Integrity remains independent of consensus networks.

---

## 10. Is timestamping legally binding?

Timestamping strengthens:

- Evidence of existence
- Chronological claims
- Dispute defensibility

Legal weight depends on:

- Jurisdiction
- Applicable evidentiary standards
- Judicial interpretation

Timestamping enhances defensibility.

It does not create automatic legal authority.

---

## 11. Can timestamps be falsified?

If timestamps are part of canonical proof objects:

- Any alteration changes the hash
- Integrity validation fails

If external anchoring is used:

- Independent verification of anchor inclusion is possible

VeriSeal makes timestamp manipulation detectable.

---

## 12. Does timestamping replace qualified timestamp services?

No.

Qualified timestamp services (where applicable) operate under:

- Regulatory frameworks
- Legal recognition schemes

VeriSeal timestamping strengthens integrity.

It does not claim regulatory equivalence.

They may complement each other.

---

## 13. Should every record be anchored externally?

Not necessarily.

Anchoring strategy depends on:

- Risk profile
- Regulatory exposure
- Litigation likelihood
- Business criticality
- Cost considerations

Selective anchoring is often appropriate.

---

## 14. Does timestamping increase cost?

External anchoring may introduce:

- Transactional fees
- Operational overhead

Core integrity does not require external anchoring.

Cost-benefit analysis should be risk-driven.

---

## 15. What risk does timestamping reduce?

Timestamping reduces:

- Backdating dispute risk
- Chronological manipulation risk
- Allegations of retroactive alteration
- Evidentiary fragility in litigation

It strengthens temporal defensibility.

---

## 16. Can regulators verify anchored proofs independently?

Yes.

If anchoring is used:

- Inclusion proofs may be verified
- Anchor hashes may be validated
- Timestamp presence may be checked independently

Verification does not require vendor permission.

---

## 17. Does anchoring create permanent public records?

If public networks are used:

- Only hashes are visible
- Underlying content remains confidential

No readable business data is exposed.

---

## 18. What is VeriSeal's timestamping philosophy?

Integrity first.

Anchoring second.

Timestamping is a reinforcement layer.

Not the foundation.

---

## 19. Is timestamping suitable for highly regulated sectors?

Yes, provided:

- Legal teams validate anchoring model
- Deployment respects regulatory frameworks
- Confidentiality constraints are maintained

Timestamping strengthens dispute defensibility.

---

## 20. What is timestamping in one sentence?

Timestamping strengthens the ability to demonstrate
that a specific record state existed at a certain time.

It does not replace structural integrity.

It reinforces it.
