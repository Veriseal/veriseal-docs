# Certification & Conformance Framework

VeriSeal is designed to evolve from infrastructure solution  
to integrity reference framework.

Certification ensures structural consistency.

---

## Purpose

The certification framework ensures that:

- Implementations follow deterministic integrity rules
- Verification remains reproducible across institutions
- Governance principles are respected
- Long-term archival compatibility is preserved

Certification is not branding.
It is structural assurance.

## Conformance Levels

### Level 1 — Protocol Conformance

- Correct hash generation
- Ledger continuity
- Deterministic verification reproducibility
- Cryptographic integrity compliance

Focus: technical correctness.

---

### Level 2 — Governance Conformance

- Audit logging requirements
- Operational transparency
- Role separation
- Access control standards

Focus: institutional robustness.

---

### Level 3 — Extended Integrity Compliance

- Cross-border interoperability

Long-term objective:
Separation between commercial entity and certification authority.

---

## Strategic Impact

Certification creates:

- Trust reinforcement
- Reduced integration friction
