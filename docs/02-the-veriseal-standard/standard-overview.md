# The VeriSeal Integrity Standard

## From product to standard

VeriSeal is not positioned as a software product.

It is structured as an integrity framework that can operate as:

- A proprietary engine
- An open verification format
- A sectoral compliance layer
- A future global integrity standard

The long-term objective is structural adoption - not software dependency.

---

## Why a standard is necessary

Digital systems have standards for:

- Payments
- Identity
- Messaging
- Encryption

But there is no widely adopted standard for:

> Verifiable digital evidence integrity.

Most systems produce logs.

Few produce mathematically verifiable events.

The absence of an integrity standard creates:

- Jurisdictional fragility
- Vendor lock-in
- Regulatory inconsistency
- Evidence incompatibility across sectors

---

## The structural layers

The VeriSeal Standard is organized into distinct layers:

### 1. Canonicalization layer
Deterministic formatting of digital events.

### 2. Hashing layer
SHA-256 deterministic hashing of payloads.

### 3. Ledger layer
Append-only chain using `prev_hash` continuity.

### 4. Proof binding layer
Binding of UX events, media, identity, and ledger entry.

### 5. Public verification layer
JSON-based public verification endpoints.

### 6. External anchoring layer
Optional Bitcoin anchoring via OpenTimestamps.

Each layer is independently verifiable.

## Vendor independence

The integrity model is designed so that:

- Verification does not require VeriSeal servers.
- Proof bundles remain verifiable without SaaS dependency.
- Public JSON acts as canonical source of truth.
- PDF is render-only and not authoritative.

The system can survive institutional failure.

---

## Governance model

The standard can evolve toward:

- Open documentation
- Sectoral adoption frameworks
- Compliance mapping
- Certification models
- Conformance testing

VeriSeal as a company builds the engine.

VeriSeal as a standard defines the format.

These are structurally separable.

---

## Standard vs. SaaS

SaaS model:
- Access-controlled
- Platform-dependent
- Closed verification logic

Integrity standard model:
- Publicly documented
- Independently verifiable
- Cryptographically deterministic
- Interoperable across sectors

VeriSeal is architected toward the second model.

---

## Path toward global adoption

Standardization requires:

1. Cross-sector interoperability
2. Regulatory compatibility
3. Institutional-grade documentation
4. Auditability
5. Long-term cryptographic durability

VeriSeal is structured to meet these requirements incrementally.

---

## Strategic positioning

In the long term, digital ecosystems will differentiate between:

- Systems that generate unverifiable logs
- Systems that produce verifiable proof objects

The VeriSeal Integrity Standard defines the second category.

This is not a feature.

It is infrastructure.
