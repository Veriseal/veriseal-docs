# Part V – Adoption, Economics & Standard Convergence

A cryptographic integrity infrastructure does not become global because it is technically sound.

It becomes global because:

- it integrates naturally,
- it reduces systemic uncertainty,
- it aligns with institutional incentives,
- it creates economic gravity,
- and it converges toward format standardization.

Part V defines:

- The structured adoption pathways,
- The economic architecture of integrity infrastructure,
- The defensibility model,
- The standardization trajectory,
- The long-term convergence logic.

VeriSeal is not positioned as a feature.

It is positioned as:

A structural layer of the digital economy.
