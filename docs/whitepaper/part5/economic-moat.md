# 5.3 Structural Economic Moat

VeriSeal’s defensibility does not rely on secrecy.

It relies on structural embedding.

---

## Switching Friction

Once proofs are:

- Issued,
- Archived,
- Referenced in contracts,
- Embedded in compliance workflows,

Switching implies:

- Re-verification complexity
- Legal uncertainty
- Governance disruption

Proof history creates inertia.

---

## Anchoring Persistence

Externally anchored proofs:

- Preserve temporal permanence
- Strengthen trust continuity
- Increase archival credibility

Historical continuity reinforces retention.

---

## Regulatory Embedding

When deterministic verification becomes referenced in:

- Compliance frameworks
- Procurement requirements
- Audit procedures

Integrity becomes mandatory.

Not optional.

---

## Network Gravity

As adoption density increases:

- Verification cost decreases
- Ecosystem interoperability improves
- Cross-sector compatibility strengthens

Moat emerges from network convergence.

Not exclusivity.
