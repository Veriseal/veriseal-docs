# Legal Admissibility Framework

VeriSeal provides deterministic structural integrity compatible with:

- EU eIDAS environments  
- US evidentiary principles  
- ISO governance standards  
- Audit and compliance frameworks  

VeriSeal does not create legal truth.

It provides cryptographic determinism.

Legal weight depends on jurisdictional interpretation, procedural context, and integration.

Its role is infrastructural reinforcement — not legal substitution.
