# Executive Summary - Condensed

## The Integrity Gap

The global economy runs on digital records.

Yet integrity still depends on internal assertions and platform control.

There is no universal, neutral, deterministic integrity layer.

---

## VeriSeal

VeriSeal is a commercially deployable cryptographic proof infrastructure.

It provides:

- Deterministic hashing  
- Append-only ledger anchoring  
- Independent verification  
- Optional public timestamping  

It integrates without replacing systems.

---

## Cross-Sector Relevance

Integrity risk affects:

- Finance  
- Legal systems  
- Insurance  
- Public sector  
- Healthcare  
- Digital platforms  

VeriSeal reduces structural uncertainty at scale.

---

## Strategic Trajectory

VeriSeal is positioned to evolve into:

A widely adopted integrity layer  
and  
a candidate global standard for digital proof.

Atlas is one systemic application built on top of VeriSeal.

VeriSeal remains independent and commercially scalable.
