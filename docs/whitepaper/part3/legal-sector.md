# Legal & Notarial Systems

## Evidentiary Fragility

Legal systems rely on:

- Document authenticity
- Timestamp reliability
- Chain of custody integrity
- Verifiable origin

Digital transformation has increased ambiguity  
in each of these dimensions.

---

## Integrity at Creation Time

VeriSeal seals:

- Content hash
- Metadata consistency
- Ledger linkage
- Optional external timestamp

This produces:

A deterministic evidentiary snapshot  
at the moment of sealing.

---

## Courtroom Implications

VeriSeal does not claim legal superiority.

It provides:

- Reproducible verification procedure
- Hash-based integrity validation
- Independent validation capability

Courts interpret evidence.

VeriSeal strengthens structural defensibility.

---

## Notarial Augmentation

Notarial systems can:

- Seal digital documents
- Anchor certification events
- Reinforce archival immutability
- Provide verifiable public records

VeriSeal supports institutional authority  
without replacing it.

---

## Strategic Importance

The legal sector validates:

- Integrity robustness
- Long-term archival stability
- Governance discipline

This strengthens standardization legitimacy.
