# Structural Digital Dependence

Modern societies have become structurally dependent on digital artifacts.

Contracts, financial transactions, regulatory filings, identity attestations, multimedia evidence, and cross-border communications now determine economic, legal, and geopolitical outcomes.

Digital infrastructure has scaled globally.

Digital integrity has not.

Most systems rely on fragmented mechanisms:

- Internal logs
- Platform timestamps
- Vendor-specific audit trails
- Localized cryptographic signatures
- Partial blockchain anchoring

These mechanisms operate within isolated trust domains.

They do not form a unified integrity architecture.

As cross-border digital interaction intensifies, evidentiary exposure expands:

- Cross-platform disputes
- AI-generated synthetic media
- Regulatory enforcement conflicts
- Supply-chain disputes
- Sovereignty-driven infrastructure divergence

Digital dependence without structural integrity creates systemic fragility.

What is missing is not another application layer.

What is missing is a deterministic, cross-system integrity layer capable of operating beneath institutions, sectors, and jurisdictions.
