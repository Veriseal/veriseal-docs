# Part I — The Structural Integrity Gap

Part I establishes the macro-structural foundation of this document.

It demonstrates that:

- Digital dependence has become systemic.
- Evidence has become economically foundational.
- Existing mechanisms address fragments, not structure.
- The absence of a deterministic integrity layer creates institutional fragility.

The conclusion of Part I is unavoidable:

Digital economies require a standardized, globally interoperable integrity architecture.

The remainder of this document proposes such a framework.
