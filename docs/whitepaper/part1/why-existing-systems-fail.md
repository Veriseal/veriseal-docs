# Why Existing Systems Fail

Existing solutions address fragments of the integrity problem.

They do not solve the structural challenge.

### Platform-Centric Logging

Internal audit trails operate within proprietary trust boundaries.

They cannot provide cross-system determinism.

### Document-Centric Signatures

Signatures authenticate actors.

They do not guarantee structural immutability across lifecycle transformations.

### Blockchain Anchoring

Blockchain provides timestamping.

It does not normalize evidence structures or define verification governance.

### Regulatory Frameworks

Regulation defines admissibility thresholds.

It does not define deterministic technical architectures.

Each solution addresses a layer.

None provides a standardized, cross-sector integrity architecture.

The missing element is a protocol-grade integrity layer:

- Deterministic
- Reproducible
- Cross-jurisdictional
- Governance-compatible
- Technically verifiable

Without such a layer, digital evidence remains structurally dependent on platform trust.
