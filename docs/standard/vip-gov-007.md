# VIP-GOV-007  
## Governance Model

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the governance architecture of the VeriSeal Integrity Protocol (VIP).

It establishes:

- Governance principles
- Standard maintenance structure
- Amendment procedures
- Certification oversight
- Conflict-of-interest safeguards

The objective is to ensure that VIP operates as a credible, neutral, and internationally scalable integrity standard.

---

## 2. Governance Principles

The VeriSeal standard is governed by five core principles:

### 2.1 Neutrality

The standard must remain:

- Vendor-neutral  
- Infrastructure-neutral  
- Jurisdiction-neutral  

No single entity may exercise unilateral control over protocol evolution.

---

### 2.2 Transparency

All normative documents must be:

- Publicly accessible
- Version-controlled
- Traceable
- Archived

Amendments must include documented rationale.

---

### 2.3 Determinism

Governance decisions must not alter:

- Historical proof validity
- Deterministic verification procedures
- Backward compatibility guarantees (except via explicit versioning)

---

### 2.4 Independence

The certification authority must be structurally separated from:

- Commercial operators
- Hosting providers
- Anchoring providers
- API vendors

This prevents systemic conflicts of interest.

---

### 2.5 Stability Over Agility

VIP prioritizes long-term structural integrity over rapid feature evolution.

The protocol is designed for archival time horizons, not fast product iteration cycles.

---

## 3. Governance Structure

### 3.1 Standard Authority

The Standard Authority is responsible for:

- Maintaining normative documents
- Approving amendments
- Overseeing certification framework
- Maintaining registry integrity

The Authority must operate under a formal charter.

---

### 3.2 Technical Committee

The Technical Committee:

- Reviews proposed amendments
- Evaluates security research
- Updates threat model documentation
- Proposes version increments

Members should include:

- Cryptographic experts
- Systems engineers
- Institutional representatives

---

### 3.3 Certification Oversight Board

The Oversight Board:

- Supervises certification authorities
- Reviews audit standards
- Validates compliance processes
- Handles disputes

---

## 4. Amendment Process

Amendments follow a structured lifecycle:

1. Proposal submission  
2. Technical review  
3. Public consultation (if applicable)  
4. Approval vote  
5. Version assignment  
6. Publication  

---

### 4.1 Versioning Model

VIP follows semantic structural versioning:

- Major version: Structural change  
- Minor version: Additive change  
- Patch version: Clarification without structural impact  

Backward compatibility must be explicitly declared.

---

## 5. Security Response Process

When vulnerabilities are discovered:

1. Responsible disclosure procedure activated  
2. Technical assessment conducted  
3. Impact classification assigned  
4. Mitigation guidance issued  
5. Amendment proposed (if necessary)

Threat model updates must reference VIP-THREAT-001.

---

## 6. Certification Governance

VIP-GOV-007 governs:

- Certification authority accreditation
- Certification suspension procedures
- Registry integrity validation
- Label usage enforcement

Certification governance must remain independent from implementation vendors.

---

## 7. Internationalization Strategy

VIP governance must allow:

- Multi-jurisdiction adoption
- Regional implementation without fragmentation
- Cross-border interoperability

Localization must not alter core deterministic properties.

---

## 8. Registry Governance

The public registry must ensure:

- Immutable certification records
- Public verification access
- Revocation transparency
- Historical traceability

Registry integrity is part of the governance responsibility.

---

## 9. Conflict of Interest Policy

Any governance member must disclose:

- Commercial interest in implementations
- Financial interest in certification bodies
- Direct participation in audit processes

Conflict must be mitigated through recusal.

---

## 10. Long-Term Objective

The governance model aims to:

- Enable transition toward formal international standardization
- Preserve structural neutrality
- Maintain institutional credibility
- Avoid proprietary capture

VIP is intended to evolve from an industry-driven protocol into a globally recognized integrity reference.
